============

I found this old C++ code lying around that I'd written back in 2001 to
ping Weblogs.com when my weblog had updated. 

[Weblogs.com Ping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_blog "Weblogs.com Ping") 

I originally wrote it so I could experiment with XML-RPC based services
using WinINet.

The code originally compiled into a DLL that could be used as a COM
component or loaded and called with a traditional exported function.

You'll find a simple Visual Basic sample as well as a C++ command line app
and a batch file I used to call it.

It's not worth anything, except possibly a history lesson.
